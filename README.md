# Memory Game

A game for memory development

## How to play?

There are 16 paired cards with different images on the 4x4 board. To win, just press the start button (the stopwatch starts) and find all pairs of cards. Yes, that's right, with stopwatch - so that you can improve (or test) your memory through stable games, and see your progress = by decreasing the total time for one game :)
